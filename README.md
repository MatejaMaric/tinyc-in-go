### About:

A Go rewrite of Marc Feeley's TinyC compiler from 2001.
The original code written in C is not included in this repository for licensing reasons.
You can find it on the following link: https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~felipe/IFT2030-Automne2002/Complements/tinyc.c

Made for fun and educational purposes.
